- start in thai mueang.
  - difficult to get scooter, got lucky. basically no tourism, place for thais to relax.
  - found out about public bus, just wait next to road and wave down.
  - everything ended up being super simpel but looked hard at first.
  - this story is an exempel that travelling can be tiring.
    - staying just a few nights at places (find food, sctooter, ...) and carrying too much stuff

- how did we get here and what happenned the last 6 months
  - talk about the countries (malaysia, indonesia, thailand, korea)
  - about work (writing and programming)
  - about korea and visit of friends
  - about vipassana

- zoom back to today, krabi, thailand

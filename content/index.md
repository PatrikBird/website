Hey ðŸ‘‹

I am Patrik, a software engineer who is fascinated by the web, especially front-end technologies.
I recently started writing technical [articles](/articles) about it.

I am currently backpacking in Asia. You can follow my journey on the [Travel Blog](/travel),
though it is currently only accessible in German.

Besides my interests in nerdy things, I like to climb, hike, eat,
and share those activities with my partner.
Additionally, I strive to live an ethical life by following a vegan lifestyle.

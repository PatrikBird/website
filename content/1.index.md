# Patrik Bird
Hey, I am Patrik a <abbr title="mainly focused on frontend web technologies, especially Vuejs and its eco system">software engineer</abbr> currently backpacking in south-east asia. <br>
You can follow my journey on the [Blog](/blog) which is, as of now, only written in German.


I enjoy to climb, hike and do various other sports. 
I also try to live a sustainable life by pursuing a vegan and _less_ waste lifestyle.

# Patrik Bird
Hey, I am Patrik and I'm currently travelling in south-east asia. You can follow me along on the [Blog](/blog) which is, 
as of now, only written in German.

I'm also a software engineer who's taking some time off, mainly focused on frontend web technologies such as the Vue.js eco system.

Outside of programming I enjoy bouldering/climbing, table tennis and various other sports.

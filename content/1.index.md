# Patrik Bird
Hey :wave:

I am Patrik, a software engineer who's very curious about front-end web technologies 
and [creative coding](https://openprocessing.org/).

I'm currently backpacking in south-east asia.
You can follow my journey on the [Blog](/blog) which is, as of now, only written in German.

Besides the nerd stuff, I enjoy to climb, hike, travel and do all those things with my partner.
I also try to live a sustainable life by pursuing a vegan and _less_ waste lifestyle.

# Patrik Bird
Hey, I am Patrik a software engineer who's interested in frontend web technologies.
<!-- This website is made to improve my programming as well as writing skills. -->

I'm currently backpacking in south-east asia.
You can follow my journey on the [Blog](/blog) which is, as of now, only written in German.

I enjoy to climb, hike and do various other sports. <br>
I also try to live a sustainable life by pursuing a vegan and _less_ waste lifestyle.

# [Patrik Bird]{.font-mont}
Hey ðŸ‘‹

I am Patrik, a software engineer who's passionate about the web, especially front-end technologies 
and [creative coding](https://openprocessing.org/){target='_blank'}.

I'm currently backpacking in asia.
You can follow my journey on the [Blog](/blog) which is, as of now, only written in German.

Besides the nerd stuff, I enjoy to climb, hike, travel and do all those things with my partner.
I also try to live a sustainable life by pursuing a vegan and _less_ waste lifestyle.
